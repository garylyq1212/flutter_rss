# flutter_rss

A new Flutter project.

- **State management: Bloc**
  - I'm familiar with Bloc, and I want to spend more time on how to architecture the code rather than scratching my head around other state management tools.
- **Navigation: AutoRouter**
  - Same reason as above. 

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies.
```
flutter pub get
```
